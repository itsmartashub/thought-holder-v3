# ThoughtHolder
ThoughtHolder keeps your thoughts safe from being forgotten. I created this **CRUD**-based Web App with **Vue.js** and **Firebase** as a backend platform which is inspired by Google Keep. </br>
Users can **create**, **edit** or **delete** notes, **change their color** for better accenting, **add tags** to notes, **pin** or **archive** them. </br>
**Search** by tags, colors, or note content. It also has a **dark theme**.
